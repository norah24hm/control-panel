# CPR- control panel 
The task idea is to build simple control panel to control the robot motion, the control panel is an interface with five buttons which are: right, left, forward, backward, and a stop button, this interface should be connected to a database to store the move entered by the user, also we want to build another interface to show the last value stored in the database. 
# project requirements:
1. Local web server to manipulate the database also for testing, download XAMPP.
2. Code editor for html, css, php, download Notepad or VS code or any.

# steps:
1. Using XAMPP run bothe Apache server and MySql and click on admin next to MySql to open phpMyAdmin web page.
2. Create a database, in this project it is called: control-panel.
3. Create a table inside our database, called: robotdir with the id attribute and make it auto increment, also add the direction attribute.
4. Using your code editor wright html, css codes to build and design the pages, php to connect to the database and to pass info from the control panel to be stored and displayed on the other page.
